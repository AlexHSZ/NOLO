# No One Left Offline
**NOLO is closing the Digital Divide in two ways:**
* In the short run, we are forming a coalition of community service organizations (CSOs) to accomplish two goals: 

1. Raise awareness of the digital divide as well as best practices to closing it; and, 
2. Turn that awareness into financial support for covering people’s broadband bills.

* In the long run, we are developing a direct giving platform for donors to cover people’s broadband bills and upgrades. This long run goal reflects the fact that it’s preferable for people to have subscriptions rather than hotspots. Subscriptions present a more stable solution that will also facilitate greater provision of digital literacy training to community members on the wrong side of the digital divide.

**Who is NOLO?**
NOLO is an all-volunteer project within Neighbors for Nonprofits, which is a 501(c)3 housed in the Richmond District of San Francisco. We recognize that context experts -- those who are closest to the digital divide -- must be an integral part of solving this massive issue. We value inclusiveness. We prioritize collaboration. We are committed to diversity and communication. 

## Goals
* 20+ coalition members, >500 people assisted, >$50,000 raised ($30,000 during Bridge the Divide campaign and $20,000 before the end of the year).

## Coalition Eligibility
* Though we are focused on the Bay Area, organizations across the nation may join
* We welcome organizations of all sizes, structures, and sectors 
* Eligibility for bill coverage will consider income, number of dependents, and intended use of Internet
* Once eligibility has been met, coverage of broadband bills will be on a first-come, first-serve basis to help meet immediate needs as quickly as possible
